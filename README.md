# Predictive Model for Traffic Management  Using ML
## Overview
This project develops a web-based traffic analysis and prediction system built with Flask, YOLOv8, and supporting libraries. The application processes live video streams to detect and count vehicles in real time, and leverages a pre-trained machine learning model to predict traffic conditions based on the collected vehicle data.

## üö¶ Features
- **Real-time Vehicle Detection & Counting**: Detects cars, buses, and trucks using YOLOv8.  
- **YouTube Live Stream Integration**: Supports live video feeds as input.  
- **Interactive Map Visualization**: Choropleth maps for visualizing traffic data using Plotly.  
- **Predictive Analytics**: Uses a pre-trained ML model to forecast traffic conditions.
